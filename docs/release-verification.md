# Release verification

`tutorials/t5_base_text2text_colab.ipynb` (`E2E`, **standalone** carrier) is a **release candidate** until the
exact notebook revision has executed top-to-bottom in a clean supported runtime. Unit tests, JSON validation,
code-cell compilation, the generator parity checks and `tools/validate_release_assets.py` are necessary checks but
are **not** runtime evidence under DIMER Notebook Specification 2.0 (REL8). This file is the durable release-gate
record for the notebook.

## Automatic coverage (static, every pull request)

CI runs `tools/validate_release_assets.py`, which checks:

- notebook JSON parses; every code cell compiles as plain Python (no `%`/`!` magics); no persisted outputs or
  execution counts; no unresolved placeholder markers; every code cell is preceded by an explanatory markdown cell;
- exactly one tutorial notebook, named in `tutorials/README.md` with its `E2E` profile, the notebook-spec version
  and the standalone carrier; `metadata.dimer` declares that profile, spec `2.0`, a §3.3 pedagogical mode,
  `standalone: true` and `generated_from` (repository, revision, module SHA-256, generator);
- the standalone carrier (ST1–ST8, PAR1–PAR4): no clone, repository install or repository import on the primary
  path; one cell per carried module (`pipeline.py`, `samples.py`, `metrics.py`), each equal to its source after the
  generator's documented rewrites; the inline `MANIFEST` equal to the committed 7-entry snapshot manifest and the
  inline `PINS` equal to the `pyproject.toml` runtime pins; the notebook byte-identical (on LF) to
  `tools/build_notebook.py` output for its recorded revision; the pinned-install cell with its
  restart-on-stale-import guard; `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE` recorded in exports;
- `MODEL_ID`/`MODEL_REVISION` bound only in the carried module cell (and repeated in the inline manifest, which the
  notebook asserts against the module before fetching), the revision a 40-hex immutable commit, and the same
  identity string in `README.md`, `MODEL_CARD.md` and `docs/WEIGHTS.md` with no stray revisions (the pinned corpus
  commit is the one allowed second hash);
- the profile-specific public-API calls (`stage_missing_files`, `verify_snapshot`,
  `T5BaseText2TextPipeline.from_pretrained(weights_dir=...)`, `fetch_corpus` from the pinned cache path,
  `read_corpus` + `build_sample_dataset(seed=SPLIT_SEED)` / `load_byod_dataset`, `validate_dataset` per split,
  `check_split_disjoint`, `known_prefix(PREFIX)`, `write_dataset_csv`, `validate_inputs` with the `num_beams` refusal
  probe, `pipe.generate` with the sanity checks on trained prefixes and the new-prefix probe, `lead_baseline`,
  `pipe.evaluate` on the frozen model under the new prefix and under `summarize: ` and on the validation and test
  splits after adaptation with the ROUGE-L assertion, `pipe.adapt` with its explicit hyperparameters, `prefix=PREFIX`
  and `eval_generation=GEN`, `pipe.evaluate` on the unseen abstracts plus the single-item `evaluation_report` and
  the trained-prefix re-check, `pipe.save_artifact`, `T5BaseText2TextPipeline.from_artifact` and the reload-parity
  assertion, and the provenance fields `weight_format`, `weight_sha256` and the `corpus` block), the six expected
  `outputs/` paths, the learner-facing statements (no score emitted, greedy decoding, adaptation to a new prefix, a
  prefix the checkpoint has never seen, the Lead-1 baseline, rouge-score-style not rouge-score-identical, no
  dispersion estimate, inputs above the token ceiling rejected not truncated, named exclusions, the Apache-2.0 corpus
  licence) and the gated-off BYOD default; forbidden patterns (credential-in-URL, any `git clone` / `github.com` /
  repository import on the primary path, a mutable `revision='main'`, direct `from transformers import` /
  `T5ForConditionalGeneration` / `T5TokenizerFast` / `model.generate(` / `from huggingface_hub import` /
  `urllib.request` / `safetensors` / `torch.optim` / `.backward(` / `pipe._model` use **outside the carried module
  cells**, `trust_remote_code=True`, `pickle.load`, `torch.load(` without `weights_only=True`, `extractall(`);
- `STATUS.md`, `README.md` and `tutorials/README.md` agree on one release-status token and no document makes an
  unsupported release-grade, production-readiness or benchmark claim;
- `MODEL_CARD.md` front matter (`model_card_spec: "1.1"`), single H1, the 19 required headings in order, and the
  immutable provenance section.

CI also installs the pinned CPU-only torch wheel plus `transformers`, `tokenizers`, `sentencepiece`,
`huggingface-hub`, `safetensors` and `numpy`, runs `ruff check src tests tools`, `tools/build_notebook.py --check`,
and the offline unit suite (`tests/test_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_adaptation.py`, `tests/test_role_helpers.py`,
`tests/test_import_boundary.py`, `tests/test_notebook_parity.py`; injected runner, token counter and corpus fetcher,
temporary manifests, no weights — `tests/test_model_backed.py` is skipped without the snapshot). These are
source/provenance and unit checks. They are **not** execution evidence.

## Executor paths

| Path | Runtime | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Google Colab (supported user path) | Colab CPU runtime (CUDA used automatically when present) | The runtime the tutorial is written for; a clean top-to-bottom run here is promotion evidence |
| Kaggle CLI kernel or equivalent fresh container | Fresh CPU or GPU container, Python 3.12 image; the committed notebook executed verbatim in a fresh interpreter with a `google.colab` shim and **no repository checkout** (the notebook is standalone) | Reproducible clean-room executor of the same class; promotion evidence |
| Local harness (pre-flight only) | Workstation, sequential cell executor with a `google.colab` shim, pre-staged pins | Builder pre-flight to catch defects before spending cloud runs; **not** a supported runtime and **not** promotion evidence |

## Supported release verification procedure

Before changing the registry status from `Candidate` to `Release-grade`:

1. resolve the exact PR/commit head under review and confirm static CI is green;
2. open that exact notebook revision in a new CPU or CUDA runtime (Colab, or a fresh-container executor above) with
   **no repository checkout**, an empty Hugging Face cache, and no pre-staged files under the working-directory
   snapshot `weights/t5-base/` or the corpus cache `weights/scitldr/` (the standalone path writes the manifest
   itself, stages the missing files from the Hub, and fetches the three pinned SciTLDR-A files from the project
   repository, so neither directory may be seeded);
3. run the notebook top-to-bottom without editing implementation cells (form parameters at their defaults:
   `USE_BYOD = False`, `SPLIT_SEED = 42`, `PREFIX = 'paper title: '`, `GEN_MAX_NEW_TOKENS = 24`, `NUM_BEAMS = 4`,
   `EPOCHS = 2`, `LEARNING_RATE = 5e-4`, `BATCH_SIZE = 8`, `TRAINABLE_DECODER_LAYERS = 4`);
4. verify that Section 1 reports `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE.repository_revision` equal to the revision recorded in
   `metadata.dimer.generated_from` and that the installed core package versions equal the inline `PINS`
   (= `pyproject.toml`): `torch==2.14.0`, `transformers==4.57.6`, `tokenizers==0.22.2`, `sentencepiece==0.2.2`,
   `huggingface-hub==0.36.2`, `safetensors==0.8.0`, `numpy==2.5.3` (an interpreter restart after the install is
   expected where the runtime's preinstalled torch or numpy differ from the pins);
5. verify every default-path stage completes:
   - pinned runtime installed from the inline `PINS` with no GitHub access;
   - the three carried module cells execute (defining `T5BaseText2TextPipeline`, `verify_snapshot`,
     `stage_missing_files`, `validate_inputs`, `evaluation_report`, `known_prefix`, `fetch_corpus`, `read_corpus`,
     `build_sample_dataset`, `filter_records`, `validate_dataset`, `check_split_disjoint`, `split_dataset`,
     `load_byod_dataset`, `write_dataset_csv`, `rouge_n`, `rouge_l`, `text_metrics`, `lead_baseline` and the
     ceilings) with no import of the repository package;
   - the inline manifest asserted against the module's constants, then `stage_missing_files(WEIGHTS_DIR,
     allow_download=True)` reporting `['model.safetensors']` (and any other absent entry) fetched from
     `google-t5/t5-base` at the immutable revision, and `verify_snapshot` returning its dict (7 files);
     `from_pretrained(weights_dir=WEIGHTS_DIR)` loading from the verified directory with `source` `local-snapshot`;
   - Section 4: `fetch_corpus` fetching the three pinned files (3,155,015 / 1,124,865 / 1,204,107 bytes) from
     `raw.githubusercontent.com` into `weights/scitldr/`, 1,992 + 619 + 618 raw papers read, `prefix_is_trained`
     `False`, and the seeded draw of 300 / 50 / 100 records with `check_split_disjoint` reporting no shared abstract
     and the three dataset digests `eadcee41…` / `6139c992…` / `ea8cb17c…`; `outputs/…_train.csv` written; the four
     dataset refusal probes each raising `ValueError`;
   - Section 5: the ceilings (`MAX_TEXT_CHARS` 20000, `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` 512, `MAX_NEW_TOKENS` 512, `MAX_NUM_BEAMS`
     8, `DEFAULT_MAX_NEW_TOKENS` 64, `MAX_PREFIX_CHARS` 64), `DECISION_RULE` and `TASK_PREFIXES` surfaced;
     `validate_inputs` writing `outputs/…_input_manifest.json` (verdict `accepted`, one recorded rejection finding
     from the `num_beams` ceiling probe); `pipe.generate` on the German-translation and `summarize: ` inputs with
     every sanity check `True` (the card-pass smoke gave `Das Haus ist wunderbar.`), then the new-prefix probe on
     one test abstract returning a one-word answer (`True` in the recorded run);
   - Section 6: the Lead-1 baseline (ROUGE-L ≈ 14.08 on the sample), the frozen model under `paper title: `
     (ROUGE-L ≈ 0.71 at ≈ 1 word) and under `summarize: ` (ROUGE-L ≈ 18.99 at ≈ 16.7 words) against
     ≈ 7.4-word titles on CPU float32, with the cell's assertion that the Lead-1 ROUGE-1 is positive;
   - Section 7: `pipe.adapt` printing epoch 0 as the frozen model, 37,757,952 trainable of 222,903,552 parameters,
     300 training abstracts, and a two-epoch history with validation ROUGE-L rising from near zero into the
     thirties (≈ 0.73 → 33.11 → 35.32 in the recorded run; `best_epoch` 2);
   - Section 8: `pipe.evaluate` on the validation and test splits with the four-way comparison and
     `outputs/…_evaluation_report.json` written (the cell asserts the adapted test ROUGE-L exceeds the frozen one
     under the same prefix — on the sample ≈ 29.97 versus ≈ 0.71, at ≈ 6.5 words);
   - Section 9: four unseen dev abstracts titled with `pipe.evaluate` returning `measured-small-sample`, the
     single-item `evaluation_report` verdict `sample-sanity`, the German translation generated again after
     adaptation (printed beside the frozen output; a change is a finding to record, not a failure),
     `outputs/…_generations.csv` written; `pipe.save_artifact` writing `outputs/…_adapter/{adapter.safetensors,
     manifest.json}` (52 tensors, about 151 MB, `prefix` recorded) and `T5BaseText2TextPipeline.from_artifact`
     reloading it with 6/6 identical outputs (the cell asserts it); `outputs/…_result.json` written with
     `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE`, the model identity and licence, the snapshot block (`weight_format`, `weight_sha256`), the
     prefix, the `corpus` block, the inference-contract items, the comparison, the artifact digest, the reload parity,
     the runtime versions and device;
6. verify the exports exist and the interpretation section matches the observed path;
7. record the notebook Git blob id, commit, runtime (platform, Python, PyTorch, Transformers, device), the model
   identifier and immutable revision, whether the model cache, the weights directory and the corpus cache were clean,
   outcome, produced outputs, the observed metrics (as observations, not a benchmark) and any warning or applicable
   `SHOULD` deviation in the tables below;
8. record no access tokens or other secrets.

A known-failing default path in the supported runtime blocks release (REL11).

## Manual clean-runtime evidence

| Notebook | Commit / notebook blob | Date (UTC) | Executor | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `t5_base_text2text_colab.ipynb` (`E2E`) | `__LOCAL_ROW__` | 2026-09-19 | Local pre-flight harness (Windows, CPython 3.12.10, CPU, `google.colab` shim, pins pre-installed) | PASS — pre-flight only, **not** promotion evidence |
| `t5_base_text2text_colab.ipynb` (`TASK-INFERENCE`, superseded) | `198685c` / `fbc9be0e4069` | 2026-09-14 | Kaggle CPU (`kurtvalcorza/dimer-nb2-t5-base-text2text` v1) | PASSED — 8/8 code cells, 285.0 s; evidence for the earlier inference-only notebook, not for the `E2E` blob |

## Recorded executions

Notebook identity is the Git blob id of `tutorials/t5_base_text2text_colab.ipynb` (verify with
`git rev-parse <commit>:tutorials/t5_base_text2text_colab.ipynb`). Wall times are the sum of per-cell times
reported by the executor and include the model download where it occurred; they are measurements for the stated
runtime, not general estimates.

| Date (UTC) | Commit / notebook blob | Executor | Path exercised | Wall | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-19 | `__LOCAL_ROW__` | Local pre-flight harness (Windows, CPython 3.12.10, CPU float32, `torch 2.14.0+cu130` with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1`, `transformers 4.57.6`) | `__LOCAL_EXEC__` |
| 2026-09-14 | `198685c` / `fbc9be0e4069` (`TASK-INFERENCE`, superseded) | Kaggle CPU (`kurtvalcorza/dimer-nb2-t5-base-text2text` v1) | Default sample path of the inference-only notebook: two synthetic prefixed inputs, `stage_missing_files` fetching `model.safetensors` from the Hub, `verify_snapshot`, `generate`, `not-measurable` report | 285.0 s | **PASSED** — 8/8 code cells, 14 files, 894 MB staged; does not cover the `E2E` blob |

## Current status

The `E2E` notebook source is complete and passes all static checks, including the generator parity checks
(`--check` OK). A local pre-flight execution of the committed blob completed the whole default path on CPU — corpus
read from the cache, validation and split, the inference contract plus the new-prefix probe, the Lead baseline and the
frozen model under two prefixes, two epochs of decoder fine-tuning, held-out evaluation, unseen-abstract generation
with the trained-prefix re-check, adapter export and reload parity — which catches defects but is **not** a supported
runtime under REL1/REL10, and it ran with the snapshot and the three SciTLDR files pre-staged, so neither the 892 MB Hub
fetch nor the corpus download has been exercised by this notebook end to end; the earlier `TASK-INFERENCE` Kaggle run
did exercise the Hub fetch and digest check of the same snapshot. The repository stays at **Candidate** until a Colab
or fresh-container run of the exact `E2E` release revision is recorded above.
